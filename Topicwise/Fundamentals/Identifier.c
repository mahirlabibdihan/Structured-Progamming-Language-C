// the names of variables, functions, labels, and various other user-defined items are called identifiers.

// The first character must be a letter or an underscore, and subsequent characters must be either letters, digits, or underscores.

// An identifier cannot be the same as a C keyword and should not have the same name as functions that are in the C library.
